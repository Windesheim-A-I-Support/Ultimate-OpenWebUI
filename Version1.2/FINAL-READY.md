## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL PRE-WORKSHOP REQUIREMENTS

### Must Verify Before Workshop

#### 1. OpenRouter Configuration ‚úÖ CRITICAL
```bash
# On server, check OpenRouter is configured
docker exec team1-openwebui env | grep OPENROUTER

# Should see:
# OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...
# or similar OpenRouter configuration
```

**If not configured:** Workshop cannot proceed with local CPU models (too slow)

#### 2. OpenRouter Models Available
- Log into OpenWebUI
- Check model dropdown
- Should see: "Claude 3.5 Sonnet", "GPT-4o", "GPT-4", etc.
- **If not visible:** OpenRouter needs configuration

#### 3. Test Full Stack with OpenRouter Model
```
1. Select Claude 3.5 Sonnet
2. Upload a PDF ‚Üí Ask question ‚Üí Verify citations work
3. Enable web search ‚Üí Ask current question ‚Üí Verify search works
4. Ask AI to write Python code ‚Üí Verify execution works
5. Try integration: RAG + Web + Code in one request
```

**All must work for workshop to succeed.**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WHAT COULD GO WRONG

### Potential Issues & Solutions

**Issue 1: OpenRouter API key expired/no credit**
**Symptom:** Models don't respond or error messages
**Solution:** Check OpenRouter dashboard, add credit
**Prevention:** Verify credit balance before workshop

**Issue 2: Participant selects local model by mistake**
**Symptom:** Very slow responses (30+ seconds) or no response
**Solution:** Help them switch to Claude/GPT-4
**Prevention:** Clear opening instructions, check everyone's model selection

**Issue 3: OpenRouter rate limiting**
**Symptom:** Some requests fail with rate limit errors
**Solution:** Wait 30 seconds, retry
**Prevention:** Stagger complex requests, don't have all 20 participants send same query simultaneously

**Issue 4: Code execution fails**
**Symptom:** Python code doesn't run
**Solution:** Check Jupyter container is running
**Prevention:** Test code execution before workshop

**Issue 5: RAG citations weak**
**Symptom:** AI doesn't provide page numbers
**Solution:** Prompt: "Quote the exact text and provide page number"
**Reality:** With good models, this shouldn't happen often
