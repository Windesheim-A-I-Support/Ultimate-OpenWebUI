## üìù RECOMMENDED ADDITIONS

### Addition 1: Model Selection Section (Add after Workshop Philosophy)

```markdown
## Choosing Your AI Model

OpenWebUI gives you access to multiple AI models. For this workshop, we recommend using **large, capable models** for the best experience.

### Recommended Models (in order of preference):

**Tier 1 - Best Experience:**
- ü•á **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** (via OpenRouter) - Excellent at code, citations, synthesis
- ü•á **GPT-4** (via OpenRouter) - Great all-rounder, excellent code generation
- ü•á **GPT-4 Turbo** (via OpenRouter) - Faster, still excellent quality

**Tier 2 - Good Experience:**
- ü•à **Claude 3 Haiku** (via OpenRouter) - Fast, decent quality
- ü•à **GPT-3.5 Turbo** (via OpenRouter) - Fast, good for basic tasks

**Tier 3 - Learning Only:**
- ü•â **llama3.2:3b** (local) - Fast but limited capabilities
- ü•â **phi3:mini** (local) - Fast but struggles with complex tasks

::: {.callout-tip}
## How to Select a Model

1. Look for the **model dropdown** at the top of the chat interface
2. Look for models with "openrouter" or cloud provider names
3. Select one of the Tier 1 models above
4. If you see "Local" or small model names (3b, 7b), those are local models

**For this workshop, use Tier 1 models for best results.**
:::

::: {.callout-note}
## About Costs

OpenRouter models use API credits. Your workshop organizer has configured access.

- Most workshop tasks cost $0.01-0.10 per conversation
- Total workshop cost: ~$1-2 in API credits per participant
- Local models (llama3.2, phi3) are free but less capable

**You don't need to worry about costs during the workshop.**
:::
```

### Addition 2: Update Module 1 Test Case

```markdown
### üß™ Test Case #1: First Contact

**Setup checklist:**
‚ñ° OpenWebUI is open in your browser
‚ñ° You can see the chat interface
‚ñ° **You've selected a Tier 1 model (Claude 3.5 Sonnet or GPT-4)**

**Step 0: Verify Your Model**

Before starting, check which model you're using:
1. Look at the top of the chat interface
2. Find the model dropdown/selector
3. **Make sure it says "Claude 3.5 Sonnet" or "GPT-4" (via OpenRouter)**
4. If it says "llama3.2" or other local model, switch to a Tier 1 model

::: {.callout-warning}
## Why Model Selection Matters

This workshop is designed for capable models. If you use small local models:
- Code generation may fail
- Citations may be poor
- Synthesis quality will suffer

**Take 30 seconds now to select a good model - it makes all the difference!**
:::

**The Test:**

1. **Open your browser** and go to: `https://team1-openwebui.valuechainhackers.xyz`

2. **Create your account** (first signup becomes admin):
   ```
   Email: [your email]
   Password: [strong password]
   ```

3. **Select your model** - Choose Claude 3.5 Sonnet or GPT-4

4. **Send this exact message:**
   ```
   Hello! Please respond with exactly these words:
   "TEST SUCCESSFUL - I am ready to help with your research."

   Then tell me which AI model you are.
   ```

5. **Expected result:**
   - Response within 5-10 seconds
   - Contains "TEST SUCCESSFUL"
   - Identifies itself as Claude, GPT-4, or similar large model

**‚úÖ Success criteria:**
- [ ] Message sent without errors
- [ ] Response received quickly
- [ ] Response contains "TEST SUCCESSFUL"
- [ ] **Model identifies as a large model (not llama3.2 or phi3)**

**‚ùå If you see "llama3.2" or "phi3":**
- You're using a local model
- Go back and select a Tier 1 model from the dropdown
- Try the test again
```

### Addition 3: Add to Troubleshooting Guide

```markdown
## Model Selection Issues

### "I don't see OpenRouter models"
- Check with facilitator - OpenRouter may not be configured
- OpenRouter requires API key setup
- Fallback: Use local models but expect lower quality results

### "OpenRouter models are slow"
- This is normal - cloud models take 3-10 seconds to respond
- Still faster than doing the work manually!
- Local models are faster but less capable

### "I want to use free local models"
- You can! But be aware of limitations:
  - Code generation may fail
  - Citations will be weaker
  - Synthesis quality lower
- Consider it "hard mode" - you'll learn the workflows but outputs vary

### "Which model is best for each task?"
- **Module 1-2 (Chat, RAG):** Claude 3.5 Sonnet (best at citations)
- **Module 3 (Web Search):** GPT-4 or Claude 3.5 (both excellent)
- **Module 4 (Code):** GPT-4 (slightly better at code) or Claude 3.5
- **Module 5 (Integration):** Claude 3.5 Sonnet (excellent synthesis)
```
