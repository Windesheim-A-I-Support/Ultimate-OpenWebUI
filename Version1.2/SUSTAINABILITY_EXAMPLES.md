## 🍞 BREAD SUSTAINABILITY

### Key Statistics (2024-2025)

**Waste at Scale:**
- 51% of bread waste generated at supplier-retailer interface
- 14% of production becomes surplus
- Only 2% recirculated to food system
- Majority used for energy production

**Environmental Impact:**
- Prevention strategies can reduce climate impact by **up to 10x** per kg of bread
- Traditional disposal creates unnecessary CO2 emissions
- Bread waste = valuable resource, not garbage

### Innovation Example: Novamyl® Enzyme Technology

**Company:** Novozymes
**Solution:** Enzyme technology extends bread freshness
**Impact Since 1990:**
- **45 million tonnes of CO2 saved**
- Extends shelf life of bread, flatbreads, rye breads, wraps, cakes
- Reduces waste at consumer level

**How it works:** Enzymes slow staling process, keeping bread fresh longer

### Valorization (Turning Waste into Value)

**What bread waste can become:**
- Succinic acid (chemical feedstock)
- Animal feed (high-quality protein source)
- 2,3-butanediol (BDO) - industrial chemical
- Bioethanol (fuel)
- Lactic acid (food additive, bioplastic)
- **Craft beer brewing adjunct** (see Toast Ale below!)
- Compost to enrich soil health

**Cost Savings:**
- Using 2% waste bread in microbial growth media = **90% cost reduction**
- Waste bread = nutrient-rich, cost-effective substrate

### Sustainable Production Practices (2024-2025)

Modern bakeries focus on:
1. High-quality, locally sourced ingredients
2. Reducing food waste at production
3. Optimizing energy usage
4. Water conservation
5. Eco-friendly packaging
6. Local community collaboration

## 🍺 BEER SUSTAINABILITY

### Key Statistics (2024-2025)

**Water Usage:**
- Traditional brewing: **7 gallons of water per 1 gallon of beer**
- Modern sustainable breweries reduce this significantly through recycling

**Carbon Footprint:**
- 80-130 kg CO2e per hectoliter (hL) of craft beer
- 0.8-1.3 kg CO2 per liter of beer
- Malting process is most energy/water intensive

**Waste Generation:**
- Brewery-spent grain (BSG) = main organic by-product
- Historically used as animal feed
- Now: high-value products through circular economy

### Case Study: Toast Ale (UK)
**Founded:** 2015
**Mission:** Reduce demand for natural resources using surplus bread

**The Circular Model:**
- Surplus bread replaces **25-30%** of malted barley
- Sources bread from bakeries, delis, sandwich makers
- Bread would otherwise be wasted

**Verified Impact (as of 2024):**
- **2.9 million slices of surplus bread** upcycled since 2016
- **5.3 tonnes CO2e avoided** in 2023 through bread substitution
- Full value chain footprint (2023): 150 tCO2e
- Net footprint after savings: 145 tCO2e

**Business Model:**
- **100% of profits → Feedback charity**
- Addresses food waste across entire food system
- Not just greenwashing - actual circular economy

**Why it works:**
- Less land needed (less barley farming)
- Less water consumption
- Less energy for malting process
- Prevents bread waste to landfill/incineration
- Creates economic value from waste

### Industry-Wide Sustainability (2024-2025)

**Major Commitments:**
- **HEINEKEN:** "Brew a Better World" programme
  - Net zero carbon by 2030
  - 100% renewable energy and fuel

**Circular Economy in Brewing:**
- BSG → animal feed, composting, anaerobic digestion
- BSG → thermochemical processes, pellets, food products
- BSG → chemicals extraction (high-value compounds)
- Water recycling systems (e.g., Sierra Nevada)

**European Brewers:**
- Massive water reduction efforts
- Circularity models minimize waste
- By-products → high-value products

## 🍫 CACAO/COCOA SUSTAINABILITY

### Critical Challenge: Deforestation (2024-2025)

**Alarming Statistics:**
- **95%+ of cocoa** in Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Cameroon grown in areas where cocoa is dominant crop
- Cocoa responsible for **>60% of agri-commodity-driven deforestation** in these regions since 2000
- **>50% of deforestation** in cocoa areas caused by cocoa itself

**Climate Threat:**
- Important West African cocoa areas will become **unsuitable for cocoa in next decades**
- Rising temperatures, changing rainfall patterns
- Increased pests and diseases

**Additional Challenges:**
- Low soil fertility
- High soil cadmium levels
- Low farmer incomes
- Child labor issues

### Case Study: Barry Callebaut - Forever Chocolate Initiative

**Company:** Barry Callebaut (world's largest cocoa processor)
**Initiative:** Forever Chocolate
**Progress Report:** 2023/24 (7th annual report)

**2023/24 Verified Achievements:**

**Traceability:**

- **46.5% of raw materials** demonstrated not contributing to deforestation
- Goal: **100% traceable to farm level by 2030**

**EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) Preparation:**
- Rigorous organization-wide approach
- Setting new benchmark for supply chain transparency
- Mandatory compliance for EU market access

**Cocoa & Forests Initiative (CFI):**
- Active in Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana (2024)
- Notable advances in sustainable farming and deforestation prevention
- CFI 2.0 action plan (2023-2025) with specific targets
- **Large-scale, long-term forest protection initiatives**

**Why it matters:**
- Halting deforestation = **most impactful lever** for aligning with Paris Climate Agreement
- Supply chain transparency prevents "hidden deforestation"

### Climate-Smart Agriculture Solutions (2025)

**Agroforestry Systems:**
- Shade-grown cocoa (not monoculture)
- Preserves forest canopy
- Boosts wildlife habitat
- Functions as biodiversity corridor
- Conserves endangered species
- Maintains genetic diversity

**Global Initiatives:**
- Collaborative programme: companies + governments
- Focus: Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Colombia
- Addresses: deforestation, forest restoration, farmer incomes, child labor

**Market Pressure:**

- Climate change threatens their future
- Sustainable practices = economic security

**Environmental Impact:**
- Deforestation = carbon emissions
- Biodiversity loss
- Ecosystem degradation

**Consumer Pressure:**
