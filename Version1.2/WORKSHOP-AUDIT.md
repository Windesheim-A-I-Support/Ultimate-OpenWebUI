# Workshop Audit Report

**Date:** 2025-10-07
**Auditor:** Claude
**Workshop:** AI-Powered Research Workshop (workshop.qmd)

---

## ‚úÖ RENDERING ASSESSMENT

### Quarto Syntax
**Status:** ‚úÖ VALID

- ‚úÖ YAML header is correct
- ‚úÖ Mermaid diagrams use proper `{mermaid}` syntax
- ‚úÖ Code blocks use proper fencing
- ‚úÖ Callouts use correct syntax `::: {.callout-note}`
- ‚úÖ No eval/execute conflicts (set to `eval: false` globally)

### Required Assets
- ‚úÖ `workshop-styles.css` exists
- ‚ùå Mermaid extension may need install: `quarto install extension quarto-ext/mermaid`

### Rendering Test
**To verify:**
```bash
# Install Quarto first
# macOS: brew install quarto
# Ubuntu: sudo apt install quarto
# Or download from: https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/

cd /home/chris/Documents/github/Ultimate-OpenWebUI/Version1.2
quarto render workshop.qmd
```

**Expected output:** `workshop.html` file

**Risk:** LOW - Syntax is valid, should render fine

---

## ‚úÖ TEST CASE FEASIBILITY

### Module 1: Basic Chat
**Test Case #1: First Contact**

‚úÖ **ACHIEVABLE**
- Requires: OpenWebUI running, any model loaded
- Current status: team1 has llama3.2:3b, phi3:mini, qwen2.5:0.5b
- Risk: LOW - This is the most basic functionality
- **Confidence:** 95%

**Potential issues:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Model might not respond with EXACT words requested (small models are bad at following instructions)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Response might take longer than 10 seconds with small models

**FIX NEEDED:** Adjust expectation:
```
Expected result: Within 10-30 seconds, you should see a response
(may not be exactly those words, but should be friendly/helpful)
```

---

### Module 2: Document RAG
**Test Case #2: Document Intelligence**

‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIALLY ACHIEVABLE**

‚úÖ What WILL work:
- Document upload (Tika is running)
- Processing (Qdrant has embeddings configured)
- Basic retrieval (RAG is enabled)

‚ùå What MIGHT NOT work well:
- **Citation quality** - Small embedding model (nomic-embed-text) may give poor results
- **Specific quotes** - Small models don't always cite properly
- **Page numbers** - OpenWebUI v0.6.32 might not extract page metadata

**Current evidence:**
```
VECTOR_DB=qdrant
RAG_EMBEDDING_MODEL=nomic-embed-text
ENABLE_RAG_HYBRID_SEARCH=true
```

**Confidence:** 60%

**FIX NEEDED:** Adjust expectations in workshop:
```
Step 3: Verify Citations

Look for:
- [ ] Answer is specific to YOUR document (not general knowledge)
- [ ] You see some reference to the document content
- [ ] Note: Small models may not provide perfect citations or page numbers

**What "good enough" looks like:**
- AI mentions specific concepts from your document
- AI doesn't make up information not in the document
- AI says "I don't know" when asked about irrelevant topics
```

**Fallback test if citations fail:**
```
Upload a paper about Topic X.
Ask: "What are the key findings?"
Then ask: "What does this say about Topic Y?" (unrelated topic)

SUCCESS = AI says it doesn't cover Topic Y
```

---

### Module 3: Web Search
**Test Case #3: Real-Time Research**

‚úÖ **ACHIEVABLE**

‚úÖ What WILL work:
- SearxNG is running and configured
- Bot detection was previously fixed
- Web search toggle exists in OpenWebUI

**Current evidence:**
```
ENABLE_WEB_SEARCH=true
WEB_SEARCH_ENGINE=searxng
SEARXNG_QUERY_URL=http://team1-searxng:8080/search?q=<query>
```

**Confidence:** 85%

**Potential issues:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Search might be slow (5-30 seconds, not 5-15)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Results quality depends on SearxNG configuration
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Small models might misinterpret search results

**FIX NEEDED:** Be more realistic about timing:
```
Expected behavior:
- [ ] You see "Searching the web..." indicator
- [ ] Wait 10-30 seconds (web search takes time)
- [ ] Response includes recent dates (2024-2025)
- [ ] Response includes some reference to sources (may not always be URLs)
```

---

### Module 4: Code Execution
**Test Case #4: Calculator on Steroids**

‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIALLY ACHIEVABLE**

‚úÖ What WILL work:
- Jupyter container is running
- Python code execution is enabled
- Basic calculations

‚ùå What MIGHT NOT work:
- **AI might not write code automatically** - Small models (llama3.2:3b) often can't do code generation well
- **Visualizations might fail** - matplotlib might not be installed or configured properly
- **No inline display** - Generated images might not appear in chat

**Current evidence:**
```
ENABLE_CODE_INTERPRETER=true
ENABLE_PYTHON_CODE_EXECUTION=true
CODE_EXECUTION_ENGINE=jupyter
```

**Confidence:** 40% (this is the RISKIEST module)

**MAJOR FIX NEEDED:**

The workshop assumes the AI will:
1. Understand the request
2. Write correct Python code
3. Execute it automatically
4. Display results

**Reality with small models:**
1. ‚ùå Might not understand complex requests
2. ‚ùå Might write buggy code
3. ‚úÖ Code execution works if provided
4. ‚ùå Image display might not work

**RECOMMENDED CHANGES:**

**Option A:** Provide the code FOR them:
```
**Step 1: Simple Calculation**

Instead of asking AI to write code, let's run this Python code:

```python
initial = 100
final = 250
years = 5
cagr = (final/initial)**(1/years) - 1
print(f"CAGR: {cagr*100:.2f}%")
```

Copy this code, then ask:
"Can you run this Python code for me?"

or

"Execute this code: [paste code]"
```

**Option B:** Make it an advanced challenge:
```
**Step 1: Test if Code Execution Works**

Try asking:
"Run this Python code: print(2+2)"

**Expected:** You see the output "4"

If this works, try asking the AI to write code for you.
If not, you can still provide code manually and ask AI to run it.

**Note:** Small AI models may struggle with code generation.
That's OK - code execution is still valuable even if you write the code yourself.
```

---

### Module 5: Integration
**Test Case #5: The Grand Finale**

‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH RISK**

This depends on ALL previous modules working well.

**Probability of full success:** 25%
- RAG works but citations weak: 60%
- Web search works: 85%
- Code execution works: 40%
- AI can synthesize all three: 30%

**Combined probability:** 0.60 √ó 0.85 √ó 0.40 √ó 0.30 = **6%**

**FIX NEEDED:** Add STRONG fallback messaging:

```
### üß™ Test Case #5: The Grand Finale

**Important:** This test combines all four capabilities. If any one isn't
working well, that's OK - you've still learned valuable individual skills.

**Your mission:** Try to use all four capabilities. If one fails, skip it
and continue with the others.

**Expected realism:**
- ‚úÖ You'll probably get RAG working (maybe without perfect citations)
- ‚úÖ You'll probably get web search working
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Code execution might not work automatically
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Synthesis might be rough with small models

**Success criteria (realistic):**
- [ ] You managed to upload documents and query them
- [ ] You managed to get some current information from web search
- [ ] You tried code execution (even if you had to write the code)
- [ ] You asked for synthesis (even if the quality varies)

**The REAL goal:** Experience the workflow, even if rough around the edges.
```

## üìù SPECIFIC EDITS NEEDED

### Edit 1: Add Reality Check Box (After Module 1)

```markdown
::: {.callout-warning}
## Reality Check: Small Models Have Limitations

The OpenWebUI instance you're using runs **small, local models**
(like llama3.2:3b). These are fast and private, but:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è May not follow instructions perfectly
- ‚ö†Ô∏è May not generate code reliably
- ‚ö†Ô∏è May not provide detailed citations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Responses may be shorter/simpler than ChatGPT

**This is OK!** You're learning workflows that work with ANY model.
When you use larger models (GPT-4, Claude), everything gets better.

**For this workshop:** Focus on the PROCESS, not perfection.
:::
```

### Edit 2: Rewrite Module 4 Test Case

```markdown
### üß™ Test Case #4: Calculator on Steroids

**Setup checklist:**
‚ñ° You're in OpenWebUI
‚ñ° Code execution is enabled
‚ñ° You're in a new chat

**The Test:**

**Step 1: Can AI Run Code?**

Ask this:
"Can you run Python code for me? If yes, execute: print(2+2)"

**Expected:**
- [ ] AI confirms it can run code
- [ ] You see output: 4

If this works, continue. If not, code execution isn't enabled - skip to Module 5.

**Step 2: Simple Calculation (Provided Code)**

Now let's calculate something useful. Ask:

"Please run this Python code to calculate compound annual growth rate:

```python
initial = 100
final = 250
years = 5
cagr = (final/initial)**(1/years) - 1
print(f"CAGR: {cagr*100:.2f}%")
```
"

**Expected:**
- [ ] Code executes
- [ ] Output shows: ~20.11%

**Step 3: Create a Visualization (Provided Code)**

Ask:
"Please run this code to create a growth visualization:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

years = np.arange(0, 6)
initial = 100
cagr = 0.2011
values = initial * (1 + cagr)**years

plt.plot(years, values, marker='o')
plt.title('Investment Growth')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Value ($)')
plt.grid(True)
plt.savefig('growth.png', dpi=100, bbox_inches='tight')
plt.close()
print('Chart created!')
```
"

**Expected:**
- [ ] Code executes
- [ ] Image might appear in chat OR you see "Chart created!" message

**Note:** Image display depends on OpenWebUI configuration.
If you don't see the image, that's OK - the code still ran!

### üéØ Advanced Challenge (Optional)

**Only try this if you're comfortable with code execution working:**

Ask the AI to WRITE code for you:
"Generate sample data of 10 cities with population and CO2 emissions.
Create a scatter plot and calculate correlation."

**This tests:** Can the AI write code (not just run it)?

**Reality:** Small models often struggle with this. If it doesn't work,
that's normal - you've still learned the valuable skill of running code
through the AI interface.
```

### Edit 3: Add Troubleshooting Section to Appendix

```markdown
## What If Things Don't Work?

### Module 1: Can't Send Messages
- Check model is selected (dropdown at top)
- Try different model
- Refresh page
- Clear browser cache

### Module 2: Documents Won't Process
- Try smaller PDF (< 5MB)
- Check file isn't password-protected
- Wait longer (large docs take time)
- Try plain text file instead

### Module 3: Web Search Does Nothing
- Verify toggle is ON (should be blue/green)
- Try simpler question
- Check if SearxNG is enabled (ask facilitator)
- Alternative: Use AI's existing knowledge for now

### Module 4: Code Won't Execute
- Verify code execution is enabled (ask facilitator)
- Try the simple print test first
- Provide complete code (not partial snippets)
- Check for Python syntax errors
- **If it never works:** Skip this module, still do Module 5 without code

### Module 5: Synthesis is Poor
- Break it down - do each step separately
- Be more specific in your request
- Accept "rough draft" quality from small models
- Focus on the PROCESS more than the output quality
```

---

## FINAL RECOMMENDATION

**This workshop is 80% ready.**

**Needs before use:**
1. Add reality check about small models (5 min)
2. Rewrite Module 4 with provided code (30 min)
3. Add troubleshooting section (20 min)
4. Test render to verify Quarto works (10 min)

**Total fix time: ~1 hour**

**With these fixes: READY TO USE** ‚úÖ

**Bottom line:** The pedagogical design is excellent. The content is engaging.
The structure is solid. It just needs calibration for the reality that small
models can't do everything ChatGPT can do.

**This is a GOOD workshop that needs REALISTIC expectations.**
