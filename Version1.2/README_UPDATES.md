2. Web search integration
3. Code execution
4. Multi-source synthesis

### Strategic Skills (NEW!)
5. Model selection strategy
6. Task identification
7. Performance trade-offs
8. Tool optimization

---

## 🎓 Pedagogical Benefits

1. **Experiential Learning** - Side-by-side comparisons
2. **Immediate Feedback** - See differences in real-time
3. **Critical Thinking** - Not just "how" but "when"
4. **Decision Making** - Match tool to task
5. **Cost Awareness** - Free ≠ inferior quality

---

## 💡 Standout Examples

### Example 1: Code Quality
Participants write the SAME complex code prompt with:
- DeepSeek → Professional, production-ready code
- Gemini → Simpler, basic code

**Visible 10x difference in quality!**

### Example 2: Citation Accuracy
Same document, same question:
- Mistral Small → Precise page numbers, exact quotes
- Gemini Flash → Faster but less precise

**Clear winner for academic work!**

### Example 3: The "Impossible Challenge"
Monte Carlo portfolio simulation:
- DeepSeek → Sophisticated financial modeling
- Others → Struggle with complexity

**Dramatic demonstration of specialization!**

---

## 🎯 Success Metrics

Participants should leave able to:

✅ Identify task types and select optimal models
✅ Switch models strategically mid-workflow
✅ Explain why they chose each model
✅ Complete complex research in 15-20 minutes
✅ Use 100% free tools professionally
✅ Teach model selection to others

---

## 🔧 Technical Requirements

### No Changes Needed!
Your OpenWebUI setup already works. Just ensure these free models are available in OpenRouter:

- `deepseek-chat-v3:free` (or `deepseek/deepseek-chat:free`)
- `gemini-2.5-flash:free` (or `google/gemini-2.5-flash:free`)
- `llama-4-maverick:free` (or `meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:free`)
- `mistral-small:free` (or `mistralai/mistral-small:free`)

**Note:** Exact model names may vary slightly in OpenRouter's listing.
