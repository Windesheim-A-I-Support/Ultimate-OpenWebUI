# Playwright E2E Testing Results

**Date:** 2025-10-03
**OpenWebUI Version:** 0.6.32
**Target:** https://team1-openwebui.valuechainhackers.xyz

---

## Summary

Playwright E2E testing framework has been **installed but cannot be fully executed** due to DNS resolution issues on the server (10.0.8.40).

### Installation Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Python 3.11 | ✅ Installed | Already present on server |
| pip3 | ✅ Installed | Successfully installed via apt |
| Playwright | ✅ Installed | v1.55.0 installed via pip |
| pytest | ✅ Installed | v8.4.2 installed |
| pytest-playwright | ✅ Installed | v0.7.1 installed |
| Chromium Browser | ❌ Failed | DNS resolution errors |

### Chromium Installation Error

```
Error: getaddrinfo EAI_AGAIN cdn.playwright.dev
Error: Failed to download Chromium 140.0.7339.16 (playwright build v1187)
```

**Root Cause:** Server 10.0.8.40 cannot resolve external DNS names (cdn.playwright.dev, playwright.download.prss.microsoft.com)

---

## Alternative: Simple API Testing

Since Playwright requires Chromium which cannot be downloaded, we ran the simple API test suite instead.

### Test Results (test-simple.py)

**Run from:** Local machine (where DNS works)
**Timestamp:** 2025-10-03

| Test | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Health Check | ✅ PASS | `/health` returned `{"status": true}` |
| Config | ✅ PASS | Version 0.6.32, Auth enabled |
| Login | ❌ FAIL | Invalid credentials (need valid test account) |
| Models | ⏭️ SKIPPED | Requires valid login |
| Chats | ⏭️ SKIPPED | Requires valid login |

**Result:** 2/5 tests passed (40%)

**Blocker:** No valid test credentials available for `Chris@tonomy.foundation`

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Fix DNS on Server (Recommended)

Enable DNS resolution on server 10.0.8.40 to allow Playwright Chromium download:

```bash
# Check DNS
ssh root@10.0.8.40 "cat /etc/resolv.conf"

# Add Google DNS if needed
ssh root@10.0.8.40 "echo 'nameserver 8.8.8.8' >> /etc/resolv.conf"

# Retry Chromium install
ssh root@10.0.8.40 "playwright install chromium"
```

### Option 2: Manual Chromium Installation

Download Chromium manually on a machine with internet access and transfer:

```bash
# On machine with internet
playwright install chromium --dry-run  # Shows download URL
wget <chromium-url> -O chromium-linux.zip

# Transfer to server
scp chromium-linux.zip root@10.0.8.40:/root/.cache/ms-playwright/

# Extract manually
ssh root@10.0.8.40 "cd /root/.cache/ms-playwright && unzip chromium-linux.zip"
```

### Option 3: Use API Testing Only

Continue with simple API tests (`test-simple.py`) which work without browsers:

**Requirements:**
1. Create valid test account credentials
2. Set environment variables:
   ```bash
   export TEST_EMAIL="test-user@example.com"
   export TEST_PASSWORD="secure-password"
   ```
3. Run tests:
   ```bash
   python3 test-simple.py $TEST_EMAIL $TEST_PASSWORD
   ```

### Option 4: Run Playwright from Different Machine

Run Playwright tests from a machine with proper DNS (like your local development machine):

```bash
# On local machine with internet
cd Version1.2
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install playwright pytest pytest-playwright python-dotenv
playwright install chromium

# Run tests
export TEST_EMAIL="your-email@example.com"
export TEST_PASSWORD="your-password"
pytest test-playwright.py --headed  # With visible browser
```

## Test Coverage Status

### ✅ Infrastructure Tests (Can Run)
- Health endpoints ✅
- Config endpoints ✅
- Service availability ✅
- Docker container status ✅

### ⚠️ Authentication Tests (Need Credentials)
- Login/logout
- User session management
- Token validation

### ❌ UI/E2E Tests (Need Playwright/Chromium)
- Phase 6: Document upload
- Phase 7: RAG/Knowledge base
- Phase 8: Web search integration
- Phase 9: Code execution
- Chat interface
- Settings pages
- Model selection

## Files Created

| File | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| [test-playwright.py](test-playwright.py) | E2E test suite with 9 tests | ✅ Ready (needs Chromium) |
| [setup-playwright.sh](setup-playwright.sh) | Playwright installation script | ✅ Works (pip installed) |
| [test-simple.py](test-simple.py) | Basic API test suite | ✅ Working |

---

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Create valid test user account in OpenWebUI
2. **Short-term:** Fix DNS on server OR run Playwright from local machine
3. **Long-term:** Set up CI/CD pipeline with Playwright tests

---

## Command Reference

### Run Simple API Tests (Works Now)
```bash
python3 test-simple.py <email> <password>
```

### Run Playwright Tests (Once Chromium is available)
```bash
export TEST_EMAIL="user@example.com"
export TEST_PASSWORD="password"
pytest test-playwright.py --headed     # With browser window
pytest test-playwright.py              # Headless
pytest test-playwright.py -v           # Verbose
pytest test-playwright.py -k test_04   # Specific test
pytest test-playwright.py --html=report.html  # HTML report
```

---

**Status:** Testing infrastructure ready, awaiting DNS fix or alternative execution environment.
