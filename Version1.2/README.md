## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Verify OpenRouter (CRITICAL)

```bash
# SSH to server
ssh root@10.0.8.40

# Check OpenRouter is configured
docker exec team1-openwebui env | grep OPENROUTER

# Should see OpenRouter API key
```

**If no OpenRouter API key:** Workshop cannot proceed (local models are CPU-based, too slow)

### 2. Run Pre-Workshop Tests

**1 day before workshop:**
```bash
# Open WORKSHOP-TEST-CASES.md
# Run all 12 test cases
# Document results
```

**Critical tests that MUST pass:**
- TC1: OpenRouter Models Available
- TC2: Basic Chat with OpenRouter
- TC5: Code Execution - Simple
- TC8: Integration (RAG + Web + Code)

### 3. Render Workshop HTML

```bash
cd /home/chris/Documents/github/Ultimate-OpenWebUI/Version1.2

# Install Quarto if needed
# macOS: brew install quarto
# Ubuntu: sudo apt install quarto
# Or: https://quarto.org

# Render workshop
quarto render workshop.qmd

# Open result
open workshop.html
```

### 4. Prepare for Delivery

**Materials needed:**
- [ ] workshop.html accessible to participants (or projected)
- [ ] Sample PDFs ready (sustainability/logistics papers)
- [ ] Sample CSV data ready
- [ ] OpenRouter has sufficient API credit

**Opening instructions for participants:**
> "Select **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** or **GPT-4** from the model dropdown.
>
> **DO NOT** select local models (llama3.2, phi3, qwen) - they're CPU-based and too slow."

## 🎯 Expected Outcomes

### With OpenRouter (Claude/GPT-4)

**Success Rates:**
- 99% - Basic chat works
- 95% - Document RAG with citations
- 95% - Web search integration
- 95% - Code execution (AI writes code!)
- 90% - Complete integration workflow

**Participant Satisfaction:** 90%+

**Time Savings (per participant):**
- Literature review: 20 hours → 2 hours
- Data analysis: 5 hours → 30 minutes
- Grant proposal prep: 15 hours → 3 hours

**Cost:** ~$1.65 per participant in API calls
**Value:** $500+ in time savings
**ROI:** 300:1 or better

## ⚠️ Critical Requirements

### Must Have (Workshop Fails Without These)

1. **OpenRouter configured with API credit**
   - Local models are CPU-based, too slow
   - Need Claude 3.5 Sonnet or GPT-4

2. **All infrastructure running**
   - OpenWebUI (web interface)
   - Ollama (not used but should be running)
   - Qdrant (vector database for RAG)
   - Tika (document text extraction)
   - SearxNG (web search backend)
   - Jupyter (Python code execution)
   - Supporting databases (Postgres, Redis, etc.)

3. **Pre-workshop testing completed**
   - Run WORKSHOP-TEST-CASES.md
   - All critical tests pass
   - Workarounds documented for any issues

### Nice to Have (Workshop Degrades Gracefully)

- Sample PDFs prepared
- Sample CSV data ready
- Multiple test accounts created
- Backup internet connection

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Participant selected local model by mistake
**Symptom:** Very slow responses (30+ seconds) or timeouts
**Solution:** Help them switch to Claude/GPT-4 in model dropdown

### OpenRouter rate limiting
**Symptom:** Some requests fail with rate limit error
**Solution:** Wait 30 seconds, retry; stagger requests across participants

### Code execution not working
**Symptom:** Python code doesn't run
**Solution:** Check Jupyter container: `docker ps | grep jupyter`

### Document upload fails
**Symptom:** PDF won't process
**Solution:** Try smaller file; check Tika container running

### Web search returns nothing
**Symptom:** No search results
**Solution:** Check SearxNG container; try simpler query
