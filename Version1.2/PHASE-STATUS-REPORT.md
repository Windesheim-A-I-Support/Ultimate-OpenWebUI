| Web Citations - Search results show sources | 🔧 | Blocked by SearxNG issue |
| URL Processing - # command with URLs works | 🔧 | Needs testing |
| Web Content Analysis - AI analyzes webpage content | 🔧 | Needs testing |

### Service Verification:

```bash
⚠️  SearxNG Search Engine
   - Port: 8081 (internal), 8080 (container)
   - Status: Running but returning "403 Forbidden"
   - Issue: Needs configuration file adjustment
   - Config: /etc/searxng/settings.yml in container

✅ OpenWebUI Configuration
   - ENABLE_WEB_SEARCH: true

   - Status: Configured but SearxNG needs fixing
```

### Issue Identified:

SearxNG is blocking requests (403 Forbidden). This usually means:
1. Need to configure `settings.yml` in searxng container
2. Need to set up proper authentication/secret
3. Or enable public access in config

### Recommended Fix:

```bash
# Check SearxNG settings
docker exec team1-searxng cat /etc/searxng/settings.yml

# May need to update settings to allow local queries
# Or restart with proper SEARXNG_SECRET environment variable
```

**Phase 8 Verdict:** 🔴 **BLOCKED** - SearxNG needs configuration fix
