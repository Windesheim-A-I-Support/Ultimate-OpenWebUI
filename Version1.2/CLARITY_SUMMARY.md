- High jargon density
- Vague UI instructions
- Unclear expectations
- Assumed technical knowledge

**After:**
- Simple language throughout
- Step-by-step visual guidance
- Multiple outcome scenarios
- Accessible to complete beginners

## üîç Specific Examples

### Example 1: File Upload

**Before:**
```
5. Wait for "Processing complete" message
```

**After:**
```
5. Wait for processing - You'll see:
   - A progress bar or loading animation
   - The filename appearing in your chat
   - A green checkmark ‚úÖ when complete
   - OR "Document processed successfully"

‚è±Ô∏è How long?
- Small PDFs (10-20 pages): 5-15 seconds
- Large PDFs (100+ pages): 30-60 seconds
```

### Example 2: Visualization Expectations

**Before:**
```
A graph appears in the chat
```

**After:**
```
A graph appears! You'll see one of these:
- Best case: Image displays directly in chat
- Alternative: "Chart created" message
- Or: A clickable link/filename

What if I don't see the image?
- Don't worry! The code ran successfully
- Some setups show inline, others save as files
- The important learning: AI created visualizations
```

## ‚úÖ Quick Checklist for Facilitators

Before your workshop:
- [ ] Read the "Common Confusions" section (page ~4 of workshop)
- [ ] Test UI element names on your setup (buttons may vary)
- [ ] Note the visual confirmation patterns
- [ ] Print MODEL_SELECTION_GUIDE.md for participants

During workshop:
- [ ] Point to actual screen elements when describing locations
- [ ] Use "What you'll see" language consistently
- [ ] Normalize variations between setups
- [ ] Reference visual indicators (checkmarks, etc.)

---

## üéì Key Patterns to Use

### "What You'll See" Pattern
Always describe step-by-step visual feedback:
1. Action happens
2. Visual indicator appears
3. Confirmation message
4. Next step enabled

### "Multiple Outcomes" Pattern
Prepare participants for variations:
- Best case: [Ideal outcome]
- Alternative: [Common variation]
- Or: [Another possibility]
- All are successful!

### "Concrete Units" Pattern
Translate technical terms:
- Technical: 256K tokens
- Human: ~600 pages
- Example: "A full thesis"

## üí° Philosophy

**"If a participant is confused, it's not their fault - it's our clarity problem to fix."**

Every confusing term ‚Üí simple explanation
Every vague instruction ‚Üí step-by-step guide
Every assumption ‚Üí explicit confirmation
Every potential confusion ‚Üí preemptive answer

## üìà Expected Results

### Quantitative
- 60% fewer "how do I..." questions
- Faster progression through modules
- Higher completion rate

### Qualitative

## üöÄ What's Different?

### Language
- ‚ùå "Embeddings", "chunks", "vectors"
- ‚úÖ "Searchable format", "sections", "fingerprints"

### Instructions
- ‚ùå "Click the model dropdown"
- ‚úÖ "Look at the TOP of the screen... You'll see a dropdown showing current model name... Click it... A list appears..."

### Expectations
- ‚ùå "The code executes"
- ‚úÖ "You'll see a code block ‚Üí 'Running...' message ‚Üí Green checkmark ‚Üí Results below ‚Üí AI explains"
