# Ultimate-OpenWebUI
Uber WebUi Implementation
bsolutely. I did a deep pass across Open WebUI’s docs + community guides and pulled everything together into a single, “no-compromises” blueprint that puts Open WebUI at the center and lights up essentially every major capability.

What Open WebUI can do today (quick map)

#Models & runtimes
• Talks to Ollama and any OpenAI-compatible API (OpenRouter, LiteLLM, etc.). There’s even a bundled :ollama image if you want one container for both. 
Open WebUI

• Exposes an OpenAI-compatible /api/chat/completions so other apps can use models you configure in Open WebUI. It also proxies the native Ollama API under /ollama/*. 
Open WebUI

#RAG / Knowledge
• Built-in RAG engine with citations, hybrid search (BM25 + cross-encoder rerank), YouTube RAG, and switchable embedding models (Ollama or OpenAI). Admin panel controls are under Settings → Documents.

• Vector DB choices: chroma, Elasticsearch, Milvus, OpenSearch, PGVector, Qdrant, Pinecone, S3 bucket, Oracle 23ai; selected via VECTOR_DB. Qdrant variables include QDRANT_URI, QDRANT_API_KEY, GPU-friendly HNSW settings, and a multitenancy mode for memory savings.

#Documents & Workspace
• Workspace: Models, Knowledge, Prompts, plus Roles/Groups/Permissions for access control. 
Open WebUI

• Knowledge lets you store persistent facts and reference them in chat with #name. 
Open WebUI

#Web search (in-chat browsing/RAG)
• Toggle Web Search and choose a provider: SearxNG, Google PSE, Brave, Kagi, Mojeek, DuckDuckGo, Tavily, Jina, Bing, Exa, Perplexity and more; with knobs for result count, concurrency, loader engine (requests / playwright), and proxies.

• Example docs for DuckDuckGo flow are provided; SearxNG works via a simple SEARXNG_QUERY_URL.

#Voice, audio, vision & images
• Local STT via faster-whisper (WHISPER_MODEL, WHISPER_VAD_FILTER, etc.) or external STT (OpenAI/Azure/Deepgram). TTS supports Azure, ElevenLabs, OpenAI, and “transformers” engines. 
Open WebUI

• Video & hands-free voice calls (mic/camera) and vision chats (e.g., LLaVA / GPT-4o). Browser mic access requires HTTPS. 
Open WebUI

• Image generation via ComfyUI, AUTOMATIC1111, Gemini, DALL·E; switch with IMAGE_GENERATION_ENGINE. ComfyUI setup is documented. 
Open WebUI

#Tools, Functions, Pipelines, MCP
• Tools & Functions: python “functions” the model can call; Tools provide a UI for managing them; Pipelines let you intercept / filter / route requests (pre/post) and even compose OpenAI-style plugin flows.

• Native function calling or OpenAPI Tool Servers—connect external tool servers (or your own microservices). 
Open WebUI

• MCP (Model Context Protocol) supported via the mcpo proxy so Open WebUI can talk to MCP servers (filesystem, calendar, etc.).
• Jupyter Notebook integration for a real code interpreter (Python kernels, plots, files) alongside the lighter in-browser Pyodide mode.

langfuse.com

• Langfuse hooks via a pipeline filter (usage, traces, evals).

#Security, auth, deployment
• OAuth/OIDC/LDAP/SCIM options, persistent-config model, and reverse-proxy guides (HAProxy, nginx, Caddy). Note: you must allow WebSockets on the proxy.

Re: “training inside the UI”: Open WebUI doesn’t fine-tune LLMs itself; it curates and orchestrates models (e.g., via Ollama “Model Builder”), tools, pipelines, and RAG. Community threads explicitly note you don’t train models in Open WebUI.

The “Ultimate Open WebUI” stack (modular, everything revolves around OWUI)

Core goals: keep Open WebUI as the hub; enable local + remote models, rich RAG, web search, tools/MCP, code execution, image/TTS/STT, and clean observability. The stack below uses Docker with optional profiles so you can turn major features on/off without re-wiring.

Components

Open WebUI (ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui) — the hub. Use :cuda if you have NVIDIA, else :main. Enable HTTPS at the proxy. WebSockets required. 
Open WebUI

Ollama — local models, embeddings.

Pipelines — plugin runner (pre/post filters, rerankers, Langfuse). 
Open WebUI
langfuse.com

Qdrant — production vector DB for RAG, with API key and multitenancy. 
Open WebUI

SearxNG — web search backend to avoid rate-limits. 
Open WebUI

ComfyUI — local image generation engine.

Kokoro-FastAPI — local, fast TTS via OpenAI-compatible API surface. 
Open WebUI

LiteLLM — optional single endpoint to unify OpenAI-compatible providers + quotas.

mcpo — MCP proxy to connect MCP servers.

Langfuse — traces/costs/evals via pipeline filter. 
langfuse.com

Jupyter — full Python code interpreter for heavy tasks.
